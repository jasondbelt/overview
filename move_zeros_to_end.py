"""
Move all zeros to the end of an array while maintaining the order of the other elements. Given an array of integers, write a function to move allÂ `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

- You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
- Minimize the total number of operations.
